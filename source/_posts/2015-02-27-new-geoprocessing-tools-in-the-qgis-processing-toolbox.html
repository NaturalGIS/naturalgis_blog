<p><a title="QGIS" href="http://www.qgis.org/" target="_blank"><strong>QGIS</strong></a> 2.8 was not officially announced yet and, 
as always happens in the QGIS project, new features are already being added to QGIS master, aka next future release, in this case 2.10.</p>
<p>At <a title="NaturalGIS" href="http://www.naturalgis.pt/" target="_blank"><strong>NaturalGIS</strong></a> we do our share of effort, 
especially regarding improvements for the QGIS "Processing" toolbox, and recently started 
to <a title="NaturalGIS QGIS commit" href="https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1905" target="_blank"><strong>add</strong></a> 
new geoprocessing tools for vectors. At the time we are writing the tools we added are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffer</li>
<li>Single sided buffer (or offset lines)</li>
<li>Clip by extent</li>
<li>Clip by polygon</li>
<li>Create points along lines</li>
<li>Dissolve</li>
</ul>

<p>Some are completely new, like the <strong>Single sided buffer (or offset lines)</strong>, <strong>Clip (vector) by extent</strong> 
(a similar tool is already available in QGIS but only to clip rasters layers) and <strong>Create points along lines</strong>, 
others are not (<strong>Buffer</strong>, <strong>Clip by polygon</strong> and <strong>Dissolve</strong>) as there are already 
plenty of alternatives in QGIS. The point here is that this "new" tools are quite faster than the already existing QGIS counterparts, 
or they offer new options.</p>
<p>For example the "Dissolve" tool is on average several times faster (up to 7 times, in our simple tests) than the QGIS counterpart, 
moreover the tool has the ability to compute some statistics on numerical attributes. See the image below:</p>

<p>Under the hood the work is done by that great software that is <a title="ogr2ogr" href="http://www.gdal.org/ogr2ogr.html" target="_blank">
<strong>ogr2ogr</strong></a>. In this case is used to run <strong>spatial SQL queries</strong>, 
using as engine <strong>SQLite/Spatialite</strong></p>
<p>More of this ogr2ogr/sql based tools will be added in the next future, especially when a few missing features will be added
to the QGIS Processing toolbox, meanwhile you can help us testing the above ones.</p>
<p>Under MS Windows you can install the development version of QGIS using the 
<a title="osgeo4w" href="http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/" target="_blank">
<strong>OSGeo4W</strong></a> installer. Under 
<a title="ubuntu" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Ubuntu GNU/Linux</strong></a> you can use the 
<a title="QGIS nightly build" href="http://www2.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#ubuntu" target="_blank"><strong>nightly builds</strong></a> repository.</p>
